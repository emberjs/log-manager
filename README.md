# Log Manager

Logging library with hierarchy and appenders.


### Developing and testing

The project uses [Broccoli](https://github.com/joliss/broccoli) as a build tool, but wraps all commands with grunt.

Installation:

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli

npm install
```

The commands are:

- `grunt build` to build the dist files
- `grunt server` to run the test server at `http://localhost:4200`
